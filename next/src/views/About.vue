            Different basketball players go to the basketball courts with different objectives. Some are eager to compete, seeking crowded courts filled with competition, while others go just to let off some steam. Since there are a limited number of basketball courts, players will need to either share the courts or join a pickup game. However, there are currently no reliable avenues to facilitate this. As a result, it is a common sight to see players heading down to multiple basketball courts to check the availability of games and courts. Our project, Next, aims to organise this fragmented network of basketball games in Singapore to help users better visualise the availability of courts/games and reduce wasted time.
